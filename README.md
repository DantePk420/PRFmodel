# PRF model
This repository creates stimuli and BOLD time series to test PRF analytical methods.  It will serve as a place where we create these stimuli based on known PRF models and see how well we can recover the PRF parameters from the synthetic test stimuli.

We expect to produce increasing complex simulations of the bold time series, adding different PRF model shapes, noise properties, eye movement properties, and HRF models.  We will use these time series of stimuli and BOLD signals as inputs to test different pRF analytical software models.  We hope others can take advantage of the repository and the data - which we will share on a Flywheel or other open site - to test their implementations as well.  

## Stimulus

In which we define for people how we write the stimulus

## BOLD Time series

In which we define for people how we write out the BOLD time series properties

# Data sharing

We aren't yet sure where we will post these data.  Probably in Flywheel, but we may also put them on the Stanford Digital repository or somewhere else.
